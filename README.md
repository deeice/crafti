Game by Vogtinator (as well as the initial and incomplete SDL port)
Crafti port for GCW0 by gameblabla

Description
============

Crafti is a Minecraft clone made by Vogtinator for the TI Nspire CX.
It was originally made to see if a Minecraft clone was possible on such limited hardware
and crafti is the result of this.

It makes use of nGL : a very fast 3D library inspired by OpenGL 1.x.

In trunk, Vogtinator made a basic SDL port for Crafti but without input !
I have fixed that and i have optimised the input code for the GCW0 Zero.

Since the GCW Zero is much more powerful than a TI-Nspire (around 10x faster),
i have enabled Perspective Correction so you should get better graphics than on a ti-nspire.
I still made the fast mode available, if you like how it looks.
